#  Uber Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to understand customer behavior, trip purposes, travel patterns, and other operational insights using Python and data visualization techniques.

##  Project Structure

- `uber-data-analysis-project(1).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - Pandas – data manipulation
  - NumPy – numerical operations
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive data analysis

##  Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data and derive meaningful insights such as:
- Common ride categories and purposes
- Travel distance patterns
- Usage trends based on time (day/night)
- Monthly variation in long-distance trips

##  Key Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Count of trip `CATEGORY*` (Business/Personal) and `PURPOSE*` (Meeting, Errands, etc.)
- **Day vs. Night Trips**: Usage frequency by time of day
- **Line Plot**: Maximum miles traveled per month
- **Box Plots**: Distribution of trip distances (all data, under 100 miles, under 40 miles)
- **Histogram with KDE**: Common trip lengths under 40 miles

##  Insights

- **Business travel** accounts for the majority of Uber usage in this dataset.
- Most rides occur during the **daytime**, indicating commuting patterns.
- A majority of trips are **short (<20 miles)**, with a few outliers.
- Monthly variations suggest **seasonal influences** on travel distances.

##  What I Learned

- Cleaning and visualizing real-world datasets
- Managing skewed data and outliers using box plots and filters
- Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for effective storytelling
- Extracting trends from categorical and numerical data

##  Challenges Faced

- Handling missing or improperly labeled entries (e.g., `CATEGORY*`, `PURPOSE*`)
- Choosing appropriate graphs for skewed or imbalanced data
- Maintaining clarity in visualizations when filtering subsets

##  Future Improvements

- Add **time series analysis** for ride demand prediction
- Explore **geospatial data** if available
- Build a **dashboard** using Streamlit or Power BI for real-time analysis

##  How to Run
